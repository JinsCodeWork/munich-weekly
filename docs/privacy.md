# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: May 2025

This website (Munich Weekly) is operated as a non-commercial, student-run platform. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring transparent data practices. Below is a summary of how we handle data.

---

## 1. Use of Cookies

We use a single technical cookie to help enforce the rule of "one vote per person" in our weekly photo voting system. This cookie is:

* Named `visitorId`
* A randomly generated identifier (UUID)
* Stored in your browser
* Not linked to your personal identity

We do **not** use cookies for analytics, advertising, or tracking.

This cookie is necessary for core functionality (to prevent repeated voting from the same browser) and does not collect any personally identifiable information.

---

## 2. What Data We Collect

When you vote, we may temporarily store:

* Your `visitorId` (from the cookie)
* The submission you voted for
* Timestamp of the vote
* (Optionally) Your IP address and browser metadata, only for abuse prevention

We do not collect your name, email, or any other personal identifiers unless you explicitly log in (e.g. via email or Google, if available).

---

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties. All voting records are stored securely on our server, hosted in Germany (Hetzner Cloud).

---

## 4. Your Rights (GDPR)

If you are an EU resident, you have the right to:

* Request access to data related to your visitorId
* Request deletion of your voting record
* Ask for clarification on how your data is processed

Please note that since we do not track personal identity by default, we may not be able to associate you with a record unless you have logged in.
