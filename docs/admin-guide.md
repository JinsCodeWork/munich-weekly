## Home Page Image Management

The large hero image on the home page can be changed as follows:

### Method 1: Via Admin Interface (Recommended)

1. Log in to the system and go to the "Account" page
2. Select "Home Settings" in the admin tools
3. Upload a new image, fill in the description and image caption
4. Click "Save Settings" to apply changes
5. **Changes are applied instantly** - both the homepage and admin interface update automatically

#### Home Settings Interface Details

The Home Settings interface provides the following capabilities:

- **Image Upload**: 
  - Click "Select New Image" to choose a new hero image
  - Supported formats: JPG and PNG
  - Maximum file size: 30MB
  - Recommended aspect ratio: 16:9 landscape format
  - **Real-time preview** is displayed before saving
  - **Current image automatically updates** to show the latest uploaded version

- **Text Configuration**:
  - **Main Description Text**: The central text that appears when users hover over or tap the image
  - **Image Caption**: Additional information displayed at the bottom of the image (e.g., photographer, location)

- **Real-time Updates**:
  - **Instant sync**: Changes appear immediately on the homepage
  - **Auto-refresh**: Admin interface updates to show current image
  - **Cross-tab sync**: Updates visible across multiple browser tabs
  - **Cache bypass**: New images load immediately without manual refresh

- **Preview and Save**:
  - The interface provides a preview of the selected image before saving
  - Changes are applied immediately after clicking "Save Settings"
  - Confirmation message appears when the update is successful
  - **No page refresh required** - everything updates automatically

### Real-time Update System

The system uses multiple mechanisms to ensure instant updates:

- **Event-driven updates**: Components communicate via custom events
- **Polling mechanism**: Automatic check for updates every 30 seconds (fallback)
- **Cache busting**: Images include version parameters to bypass browser cache
- **Smart sync**: Only updates when configuration actually changes

### Method 2: Edit Files Directly (For Developers)

If you need to edit files directly:

1. Prepare a high-quality image, recommended resolution at least 1920x1080 pixels
2. Name the image `hero.jpg` (keep JPEG format)
3. Upload to the `/frontend/public/images/home/` directory on the server
4. Edit the `/frontend/public/config/homepage.json` config file (if exists)
5. **Note**: Direct file edits may not trigger real-time updates

### Image Path Explanation

The home page image is stored at:
```
/images/home/hero.jpg?v={timestamp}
```

- Version parameter `?v={timestamp}` ensures cache busting
- This path is accessible in different environments:
  - Development: `http://localhost:3000/images/home/hero.jpg`
  - Production: `https://munichweekly.art/images/home/hero.jpg`

### Configuration Storage

Homepage configuration is stored in:
```
/frontend/public/config/homepage.json
```

Structure:
```json
{
  "heroImage": {
    "imageUrl": "/images/home/hero.jpg",
    "description": "Main description text",
    "imageCaption": "Image caption text"
  },
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Image Best Practices

- Use landscape images, aspect ratio about 16:9
- Choose high-resolution, clear images (1920x1080 or higher recommended)
- Consider the effect of text on a dark background (a semi-transparent black overlay appears on hover)
- The image theme should be relevant to the website (photography works, cameras, photographers, etc.)
- Avoid overly complex or bright images, which may affect hover effect and text readability

### Image Text Management

Via the admin interface, you can set the following text content:

1. **Central Description Text**: Main text displayed in the center of the image on hover
2. **Image Caption**: Additional info displayed at the bottom of the image on hover (e.g. photographer, location, etc.)

### Troubleshooting

If updates don't appear immediately:

1. **Check console logs** for any error messages
2. **Wait 30 seconds** for the polling mechanism to trigger
3. **Refresh the page** manually as a last resort
4. **Verify authentication** - ensure you're logged in as admin

### Technical Details

- **Backend sync**: Images uploaded to `/backend/uploads/hero.jpg`
- **Frontend sync**: Automatically copied to `/frontend/public/images/home/hero.jpg`
- **API endpoints**: `/frontend-api/config` for public access, `/frontend-api/admin/config` for admin operations
- **Event system**: Uses `configUpdated` events and localStorage for cross-tab communication
